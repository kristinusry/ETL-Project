Project Title: Folsom Lake Water Level and Weather Conditions
Project Description: Every year, the water levels in Folsom Lake rise and lower controlled by the dam system along the North, Middle and South Forks of the American rivers. This fluctuation is most commonly reported by the elevation of the water. At the lakeâ€™s max capacity, the elevation is 466ft. During significant drought seasons, it has dropped into the low 300s. In this project, I will join the Folsom Lake elevation data with historical data of the weather conditions at the lake.
